                  As consumers, we have probably bought some products or
                  services online for more choice, convenience &amp;amp; better
                  deals instead of visiting a brick and mortar store.

                  As businesses, we have considered or perhaps launched on-line
                  wholesale and procurement solutions to scale-up our business,
                  improve efficiencies and increase sales.
